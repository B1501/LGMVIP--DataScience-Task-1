# DataScience-Task-1 - Iris Flowers Classification ML project
The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
I used Machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression model, KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor) model, Decision Tree model,Support Vector Machine model.
# Step By Step process while doing basic data science project:
1. Import the Libraries
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Data Cleaning and preprocessing
4. Analyzing Data and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
5. Feature Separation and Splitting the Dataset
6. Model Implementation (ML models)
7. Model Comparison
